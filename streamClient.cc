  // The only difference between video streaming in HLS and the simpleClient
  // is that the simpleClient is reading a video file locally. On the other
  // hand, HLS is getting the video from a playlist that specifies a list of
  // video segments. The playlist and the video segments are obtained over
  // HTTP.

  // Both playlist and video segments are sent using default transfer
  // encoding, which means they can share some code.

  // Basically, this is combining the client program in lab 2 and the
  // simpleClient in this skeleton code. For more information, please refer
  // to the handout.

  std::cout << "Attempting to stream video from: " << playlistUrlStr
            << std::endl;

  // Parse the playlistUrlStr as a URL object. Just like what we did in
  // lab 2.

  // Attempt to download the playlist through HTTP, as if the playlist is an
  // base HTML file
  // Note:
  //  - Handle 404 Not found and 403 Forbidden are required

  // If the download succeeded, try to parse the response body as a Playlist 
  // object using Playlist::parse

  // Note:
  //  - remember to delete any object that is no longer needed, for example
  //    we do not need the playlist's URL object now)
  //  - Also, make sure any parsed object is not NULL (URL, Playlist ...)

  // Get a video player. Refer to simpleClient.cc for more information

  // For each video segment in the Playlist object, download the video segment
  // as over HTTP, as if the video segments are HTTP reference objects
  // Note:
  //  - Make sure each segment is downloaded successfully. If not, show some
  //    error messages and exit the program is fine.

  // Stream the video segment (in the response body) to the player using
  // Player::stream
  // Note:
  //  - Make sure Player::stream returns true. (What if a user closes the
  //    VideoPlayer early?)


  // Because the main thread (this thread) is downloading the video and is very
  // likely to end before the playback, which is handled by another thread.
  // If we let the main thread to terminate, the child thread (VideoPlayer)
  // also ends. Wait for the player to finish playback using
  // VideoPlayer::waitForClose

  // Clean up!
